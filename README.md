<h1>Digital Library Management System - Project</h1>

<p>I'm excited to share my recent project - a digital library management system built with cutting-edge technologies to offer a seamless and engaging user experience.</p>

<h2 id="technologies">Built with:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Hibernate & JPA:</strong> For seamless persistence and object-relational mapping, ensuring smooth data interaction between the application and the MySQL database.</li>
  <li><strong>Spring Security:</strong> Providing robust authentication and authorization, guaranteeing secure access.</li>
  <li><strong>Redis:</strong> High-performance caching for information retrieval, making browsing fast and efficient.</li>
  <li><strong>REST APIs:</strong> Powering the backend and enabling communication with various client applications, ensuring flexible interaction.</li>
  <li><strong>Lombok & Builder:</strong> Simplifying boilerplate code, making development efficient and elegant.</li>
  <li><strong>Postman:</strong> For API testing and exploration, facilitating development and ensuring smooth API functionality.</li>
  <li><strong>Maven:</strong> Managing dependencies and build automation, guaranteeing a reliable and reproducible build process.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="working-of-project">Working of the project</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>User Roles:</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Admin:</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Secured admin creation.</li>
        <li>Manage student details (view by student id).</li>
        <li>Manage books (create, view, delete).</li>
      </ul>
    <li><strong>Student:</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Create profile with credentials.</li>
        <li>Manage profile (update, delete).</li>
        <li>Issue and return books.</li>
        <li>View book details.</li>
      </ul>
  <li><strong>Functionalities:</strong></li>
    <li>Search books by name, author, genre, ID, pages.</li>
    <li>Spring Security for user authentication and authorization.</li>
    <li>Redis caching for efficient student data retrieval.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Check cache for existing data.</li>
        <li>Fetch data from database if not cached.</li>
        <li>Update cache with fetched data.</li>
      </ul>
</ul>

<h2 id="skills-gained">Skills Gained:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Java Spring Framework:</strong> Deepened understanding of Spring core concepts and advanced features like Spring Security and Spring Data.</li>
  <li><strong>RESTful API Development:</strong> Gained proficiency in designing and implementing efficient REST APIs for data access and manipulation.</li>
  <li><strong>Database Management:</strong> Strengthened expertise in database design, querying, and optimization using Hibernate and JPA.</li>
  <li><strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> Employed caching techniques and efficient data structures to enhance application responsiveness.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="looking-forward">Looking Forward</h2>
<p>This project has fuelled my passion for building user-friendly, impactful software solutions. Now, I'm eager to take the next step in my learning journey by seeking an internship where I can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Apply my theoretical knowledge in a real-world setting and gain hands-on experience with cutting-edge technologies like Hibernate, JPA, Spring Security, and REST APIs.</li>
  <li>Contribute to a collaborative team environment and learn from experienced professionals.</li>
  <li>Explore and refine my technical skills while tackling challenging problems and finding innovative solutions.</li>
</ul>
